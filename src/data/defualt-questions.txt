    "explanation": "The European Union provides standard contractual clauses that may be used to facilitate data transfer. That would be the best choice in a case where two different companies are sharing data. If the data was being shared internally within a company, binding corporate rules would also be an option. The EU/U.S. Privacy Shield was a safe harbor agreement that would previously have allowed the transfer but is no longer valid.",

    "explanation": "Supply chain risks occur when the adversary is interfering with the delivery of goods or services from a supplier to the customer. This might involve tampering with hardware before the customer receives it or using social engineering to compromise a vendor employee. Hacking into a web server run in an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environment is not a supply chain risk because the web server is already under the control of the customer.

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Destruction is the most complete method of ensuring that data cannot be exposed, and organizations often opt to destroy either the drive or the entire workstation or device to ensure that data cannot be recovered or exposed. Sanitization is a combination of processes that ensure that data from a system cannot be recovered by any means.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Many organizations require the destruction of media that contains data at higher levels of classification. Often the cost of the media is lower than the potential costs of data exposure, and it is difficult to guarantee that reused media doesn't contain remnant data. Tapes can be erased by degaussing, but degaussing is not always fully effective. Bitrot describes the slow loss of data on aging media, while data permanence is a term sometimes used to describe the life span of data and media.",

    "explanation": "Typically, data breaches cause the greatest reputational damage as a result of threats to data at rest. Data at rest with a high level of sensitivity is often encrypted to help prevent this. Decryption is not as significant of a threat if strong encryption is used and encryption keys are well secured. Insider threats are a risk, but the majority of insider threat issues are unintentional rather than intentional, making this risk less likely in most organizations.",

      "The organization's DLP system may flag the new system due to the difference in data labels."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Downgrading systems and media is rare due to the difficulty of ensuring that sanitization is complete. The need to completely wipe (or destroy) the media that systems use means that the cost of reuse is often significant and may exceed the cost of purchasing a new system or media. The goal of purging is to ensure that no data remains, so commingling data should not be a concern, nor should the exposure of the data; only staff with the proper clearance should handle the systems!
